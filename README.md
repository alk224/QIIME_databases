# QIIME_databases
Minimal database files for QIIME.

Greengenes (16S).  97% files for full sequence and reduced to v4 only.
"Withmock" files contain representative sequences for mock communities
found in my QIIME_test_data repository.

 UNITE (ITS).  Dynamic (97-99%) files for full sequence and reduced to
ITS1 or ITS2 only.

I removed sequences from MAARJAM database which contained "N" characters.

Works great for me, but use at your own risk.
